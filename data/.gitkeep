# Data Directory

This directory contains processed data files for the Lidarr Music Importer.

## Contents

- `filtered_artist_album_pairs.csv` - Processed album data ready for import
- Other CSV files generated during processing

## Privacy Note

Data files in this directory may contain personal information (your music preferences) and are excluded from version control by default.

## File Formats

All CSV files should follow this format:
```csv
artist,album,status
"Artist Name","Album Title","status_code"
```

## Status Codes

### Successful
- `completed` - Artist added and album successfully monitored
- `album_monitored` - Existing artist, album successfully monitored

### Temporary Failures (Retryable)
- `refresh_triggered` - Album monitoring failed, metadata refresh triggered
- `failed:connection_error` - Network/connection issues
- `failed:timeout` - Request timeout
- `failed:api_error` - General API error
- `failed:unexpected_error` - Other unexpected errors

### Permanent Failures (Will be skipped)
- `failed:no_lookup_results` - Artist not found in any metadata sources
- `failed:artist_not_found` - Artist not found (404 from metadata APIs)
- `failed:invalid_data` - Artist data is invalid/malformed
- `failed:api_auth` - API authentication/authorization issues
- `failed:already_exists` - Artist already exists (race condition)

### Other
- `dry_run` - Processed in dry-run mode (testing only)

## Smart Retry Logic

Use `--skip-completed` to automatically skip successful items AND permanent failures, retrying only temporary failures that might succeed on subsequent runs.
